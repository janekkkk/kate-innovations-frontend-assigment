## Usage

### Global dependencies

Make sure you have Node 16 installed.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

### Install dependencies
For all these steps you can use npm as well if you want.
```
yarn install
```

### Run development server

```
yarn start
```

Open your browser on http://localhost:3000

Vite will watch for changes in the `./src` directory and render them on the fly.

It also starts a fake server with a REST API on http://localhost:4000. It has frequently asked questions (/faqs) and products (/products)

### Build production bundles

```
yarn build
```

### Assets

All the designs are stored in the `./designs` directory.
All other images needed to implement the designs are added to the `./public/products` directory.

## Stack

The boilerplate consists of following tech stack and should run out of the box with a basic setup - 

- Vite
- Typescript
- Sass and Tailwind
- Testing with Jest and React Testing Library
- Json-server as a fake REST API

## Questions

- Q: How much time do I have?
- A: Try to limit your time to 4 hours total. You can build as long as you want, but it's not a requirement at all.

- Q: Can I use React or another framework or library?
- A: Yes, you can use whatever you want! However, this startup project might be nice to get started right away. It uses React.

If you have any other questions while working on the exercise feel free to reach out. We will be happy to help.

Happy coding!
